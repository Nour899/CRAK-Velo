# Crak-Velo

CRAK-Velo is a semi-mechanistic model that incorporates chromatin accessibility data into the estimation of RNA velocities. It offers biologically consistent estimates of developmental trajectories and enables precise cell-type deconvolution and examine the interactions between genes and chromatin regions.
